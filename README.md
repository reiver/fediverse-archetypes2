# Fediverse Archetypes

This is an analysis of the **types** of people seen on the Fediverse.

In this document, these _**types** of people_ are called **archetypes**.

This analysis is meant to be descriptive.
I.e., it is just trying to list out what is there.

## What Is An Archtype

This analysis tries to list out a number of **archetypes**.

**An archetype is an _idealized form_ of some _aspect_ of an individual.**

For example, some **archetypes** might be —
* father,
* mother,
* brother,
* sister,
* husband,
* wife,
* CTO,
* CEO,
* libertarian,
* socialist,
* bitcoin owner,
* bitcoin enthusiast,
* bitcoin hater,
* _etc_.

You can also probably already see that an individual could express more than one **archetype**.

For example, a single individual could be — a _father_, a _husband_, a _brother_, a _CTO_, and a _libertarian_.

The **archetypes** an;individual expresses could also change over their life-time too.

For example —
before someone has a child, they wouldn't be a _father_ or a _mother_ yet;
but after they have a child, they would become a _father_, or a _mother_.

## Personas & Segments

Some _UX people_ might, instead of using the label **archetype**, call it a **persona**.

Some _marketers_ might, insteaed of using the label **archetype**, call it a **segment**.

The labels **persona** & **segement** are, in practice, very similar to **archetype**.

This document will use the label **archetype** (rather than **persona** or **segment**).
But it might help you to know these are often in practice the very similar, if not the same thing.
