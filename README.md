# Fediverse Archetypes

This is an analysis of the some of the **types** of people seen on the Fediverse.

In this document, these **types** _of people_ are called **archetypes**.

This analysis is meant to be **descriptive**.
I.e., it is just trying to list out what is there.
It is _not_ a statement of what should or shouldn't be there.
And it is neither an endorsement or a condemnation of anything that is there.
It is just **description** of what seems to be observed to be there.

Note that this analysis is highly likely to be unrepresentative.

A manual categorization was done of the follower-list and following-list of a number of accounts.

## What Is An Archtype

This analysis tries to list out a number of **archetypes**.

**An archetype is an _idealized form_ of some _aspect_ of an individual.**

For example, some **archetypes** might be —
* father,
* mother,
* brother,
* sister,
* husband,
* wife,
* CTO,
* CEO,
* libertarian,
* socialist,
* bitcoin owner,
* bitcoin enthusiast,
* bitcoin hater,
* _etc_.

You can also probably already see that an individual could express more than one **archetype**.

For example — a single individual could be — a _father_, a _husband_, a _brother_, a _CTO_, and a _libertarian_ during a certain span of their life.

The **archetypes** an individual expresses could also change over their life-time too.

For example —
before someone has a child, they wouldn't be a _father_ or a _mother_ yet;
but after they have a child, they would become a _father_, or a _mother_.

## Personas & Segments

Some _UX people_ might, instead of using the label **archetype**, call this a **persona**.

Some _marketers_ might, insteaed of using the label **archetype**, call this a **segment**.

The labels **persona** & **segement** are, in practice, very similar to **archetype**.

This document will use the label **archetype** (rather than **persona** or **segment**).
But it might help you to know these are often in practice the very similar, if not the same thing.

## Parameterization By Topics

Some **archetypes** seem to be be **parameterized** based on **topics**.

Therefore it makes sense to talk about **topics**.

Here is an example — the topic of **open source software**.

Someone can express the **archetype** of — a **user** of **open source software**.

Someone can express the **archetype** of — a **enthusiast** of **open source software**.

Someone can express the **archetype** of — a **advocate** of **open source software**.

Someone can express the **archetype** of — a **software developer** of **open source software**.

Although if someone is a **software developer** of **open source software**, then it would logically follow that they also express (the more general) **archetype** of **software developer**.

Someone can express the **archetype** of — a **hater** of **open source software**.

Because of certain **archetypes** being able to be thought of as certain types of **parameterizations** of **topics** it can be helpful, and even better, to list **topics** when trying to understand **archetypes**.
